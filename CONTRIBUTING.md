# Contribution rules for lukasz26671.github.io

You may ONLY make changes that don't change overall website look. By that, 
I mean:
  -adding css classes
  -making css class responsive
  -adding js functions
  -adding transition effects THAT ARE TESTED BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION!!!!
  -adding audio files (only allowed by contacting with me beforehand)
You can't:
  -delete key components like a music player or menu
  -mess with audio files
  -mess with json files
  -rewrite whole page without my permission
  -copy and paste website code and making it your own by changing only a few elements
  -change redirections to make user go to your page
  
 Those are the key parts, and if you do somehow mess with them, 
 this website won't be available on public github from now and on.
