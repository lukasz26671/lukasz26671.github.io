Basically it's my first website project in HTML, CSS and JS, I tried to get the most out of this based on my current skills and I think that it went quite good.

I hope you'll like this :D

P.S.

I'm constantly updating it do keep it up-to-date with latest solutions but I'm still a human - I can miss something.

If you have any questions or tips for me please send me an email :) lukasz266713@gmail.com
