Basically it's my first website project in HTML, CSS and JS 
which turned out to be quite good. 
It's not very advanced cuz I'm still a student in a primary school, 
but I tried my best to do so :) 

I hope you'll like this :D

P.S. 
I could use some advice to programming.
If You could be so kind and tell me what I could do better and optimize my code :)

  OLD MEME ALERT
  
[btw ooh yeah yeah]
