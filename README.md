## INFO

This project was created by me, in 2016. It is still updated, maybe not regularly, but still. 
I wanted to actually do something instead of learning new languages.
I know, I know. Final effect isn't very amazing but I like it! :D
I find that it looks very nice in terms of design, and functionality.
Making my own webplayer wasn't actually difficult, but it's far from perfect.
Youtube API integration is necessary to have more songs without uploading them directly to some kind of hosting
or to GitHub ;)

## How audio player works?

Well, I made two separate projects for audio player, excluding this one. Main purpose is of course decentralizing parts to restrict new bugs. 
Both projects are private at the moment because i don't want to share their source code.
